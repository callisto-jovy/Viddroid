# Viddroid

Viddroid is a desktop application, which allows to stream, download and bookmark tv-shows, movies, and anime.

By itself, Viddroid includes some streaming providers. However, it is planned to construct a custom scripting-language,
which would enable users to include custom providers. But, before this enhancement, the app has to be in a stable and
semi-finished state.

If you are searching for an extensive Android application which accomplishes the same feat, have a look
at [Cloudstream](https://github.com/recloudstream/cloudstream).

As this project could get pretty big, help is always appreciated.
